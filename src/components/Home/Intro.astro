      Hello there, I'm Dylan. I'm a Software Architect at Acro Media where I
      work with various tech to develop full-stack web apps. I am passionate
      about programming and open source, and I'm always looking for the upcoming
      hot tech stack. These days I primarily work with PHP, Typescript, and
      Next.js.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      When I'm not coding you can probably catch me playing video games, board
      games, and tabletop RPGs, playing music, or laying low with my family.
